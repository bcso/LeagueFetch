{"name":"LeagueFetch","tagline":"","body":"### Welcome to League Fetch.\r\nThis is a novel python script leveraging the League of Legends API, testing out what is possible with it. Users may choose between one of two options - first is to retrieve histories for their past 10 games and associated Match History ID, second is to scrape summoner in-game-names. Match History ID can be easily used to query match history details by concatenating it in the request URL.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ git clone https://github.com/bcso/LeagueFetch.git\r\n$ cd LeagueFetch\r\n$ python main.py\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Finding match history\r\nFind a list of your last 10 most recent match histories and the corresponding duration. This is used mainly for development purposes - ID's are unique and can be used to find more detailed match details.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ python main.py \r\n1. Find your match history\r\n2. Scrape some names\r\n3.
