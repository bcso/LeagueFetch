{"name":"LeagueFetch","tagline":"","body":"### Welcome to League Fetch.\r\nThis is a novel python script leveraging the League of Legends API, testing out what is possible with it. Users may choose between one of two options - first is to retrieve histories for their past 10 games and associated Match History ID, second is to scrape summoner in-game-names. Match History ID can be easily used to query match history details by concatinating it in the request URL.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ cd your_repo_root/repo_name\r\n$ python main.py\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Finding match history\r\nFind a list of your last 10 most recent match histories and the corresponding duration. This is used mainly for development purposes - ID's are unique and can be used to find more detailed match details.\r\n\r\n### Scraping names\r\nScrape some names that start from the specified user ID. The scraper will increment by 1 from this start point.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nIn 2015 Brian So (@bcso) decided to create his first GH page for this project. This is a proof of concept project playing around with Riot's League of legends API to test endpoints.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
